# VaultSync â€“ Encrypted Personal Cloud Sync Engine
---
### Overview
VaultSync is a self-hosted, end-to-end encrypted file sync engine that unifies files across multiple cloud providers (Google Drive, Dropbox, local disk) with git-like versioning and conflict-free merging using CRDTs. Think of it as a privacy-first, decentralized Dropbox with Merkle trees for efficient sync.
